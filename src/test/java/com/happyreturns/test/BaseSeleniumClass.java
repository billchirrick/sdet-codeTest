     *  CHALLENGE :
     *  For our challenge, we need to create a Selenium test that navigates to Google.com
     *  and performs a search for "Happy Returns".
     *
     *  After the results are displayed, assert that www.happyreturns.com is the first result
     *  returned from Google.
     *
     *  Notes : Feel free to create classes, rename this class, approach this challenge however you'd like.
     *  Keep it simple or get fancy with it if you have time.
     *
     *  Time: 30 minutes
